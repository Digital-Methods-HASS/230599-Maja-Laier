#First, I Install the neccesary packages, in order to be able to work the useful functions ----
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")

#Then I activate said packages by the library-command.
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

#First I want to see the general dataset. I do that by importing it as a csv.file ----
fatal_police_shootings <- read.csv("Final_Assignment/Dataset/Police_Killings.csv")

#Next, I want to get a general overwiew of the "race" column I am working with. ----
#This is done through the count function. This gives me a pretty good overall idea of the representation, but it is not very visual
Police_Killings %>% 
  count(race, sort = TRUE)

#Now, I want to see this representation visualized. 
#First, I create another data.frame with the races counted percentwise. 
Police_Killings %>% 
  count(race, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(total_number = 5861) %>% 
  mutate(percentate = n/total_number) -> Race_percent

#Next, I want to visualize these percentages through a col_plot ----
Race_percent %>% 
  mutate(race = reorder(race,n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=race, y=percentate))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+

        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", color = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"))+
  xlab(NULL)+
  labs(x="Race", 
       y= "Percentage",
       title = "Race percentage")

#This clealy shows, how the majority representation in the period 2015-2020 is white, 2nd place being black

#Next, I want to see if there is any particular areas which are more prone to police killings.----
Police_Killings %>% 
  count(state, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(15) %>% 
  mutate(state = reorder(state,n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = n))+

#The last, and most complicated thing, I want to visualize is the race-dispersency of killings, over the entire timeframe of the dataset. ---- 
#This wil help me notice general changes in number of each race represented, over the duration of 5 years.

# First, I make a count pr. year, by creating a new column in my dataset 
Police_Killings %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  mutate(Year = year(date)) -> Police_Killings

Next, I create a plot for the total amount of killings, regardless of race. 
Police_Killings %>% 
  count(Year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n))+
  geom_line(lwd = 1.3)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", color = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"))+
  xlab(NULL)+
  labs(x="Year", 
       y= "Number of deaths",
       title = "Total death count (2015-2020)")

#Lastly, I can create a vine chart which represents each raceÂ´s number of killings pr. year, over the total time period 
Police_Killings %>% 
  count(Year, race) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n, color = race))+
  geom_line(lwd = 1.2)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", color = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 13, color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 15, color = "Black"))+
  xlab(NULL) +
  labs(x = "Years",
       y = "number of killings",
       title = "Killings Dispersed on Race")

#This graph shows that The goups have very different experiences throughout the 5-year period.
#Blacks experience a steady rise in deaths from 2017-2019 followed by a steep drop from 2019-2020 
#Whites experience the largest number by far, but the most steady decline in numbers
